# 🌊 Ocean Heatwave Detector (AI-Based System)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an AI-based system to detect and predict marine heatwaves using oceanographic and environmental data. The model is built from scratch using the Delta Rule (Widrow-Hoff Learning Algorithm), a supervised learning approach that updates weights using gradient-based optimization.
